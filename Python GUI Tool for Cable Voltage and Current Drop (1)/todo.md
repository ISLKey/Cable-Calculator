# Cable Calculator Tool Development Progress

## Phase 1: Research cable specifications and electrical calculations
- [x] Research voltage drop calculation formulas
- [x] Research current drop calculation formulas (Note: This is typically addressed through voltage drop and Ohm's Law, as 'current drop' isn't a standard term for cable loss.)  
- [x] Research standard AWG wire gauge specifications
- [x] Research alarm cable specifications and resistance values
- [x] Research network data cable specifications and resistance values
- [x] Research temperature coefficients for copper conductors
- [x] Research standard voltage levels for alarm and data systems

## Phase 2: Design application architecture and data structures
- [x] Design data structures for cable specifications
- [x] Design calculation engine architecture
- [x] Plan GUI layout and user interface flow
- [x] Define input validation requirements

## Phase 3: Implement core calculation engine
- [x] Implement voltage drop calculations
- [x] Implement current drop calculations (handled via voltage drop)
- [x] Implement reverse calculations for core requirements
- [x] Add support for parallel conductor calculations

## Phase 4: Develop GUI interface with PySimpleGUI
- [x] Create main window layout
- [x] Implement input controls
- [x] Implement output display
- [x] Add calculation mode selector

## Phase 5: Add advanced features and validation
- [x] Add input validation and error handling
- [x] Implement export functionality (CSV/PDF)
- [x] Add save/load presets feature
- [x] Add dark/light mode toggle

## Phase 6: Test application and create documentation
- [x] Test all calculation scenarios
- [x] Validate against known examples
- [x] Create user documentation
- [x] Create installation instructions

## Phase 7: Deliver final application to user
- [X] Package application files
- [ ] Provide usage instructions
- [ ] Deliver to user
